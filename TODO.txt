X Limit paddle movement to screen edge
X Scale everything to the window in render()
X Implement ball
X Implement blocks and their collision detection
X Implement the basic game - a game over screen, a game win screen
X Implement sound effects
X Implement pausing
X Implement instructions
X Implement Menu screen and game restarting
X Implement music

Implement resolution black rectangles


Separation issues:

can't get color out of block
screen graphics details are stored in the game state class
Implement the instructions screen






BUGS:
X Flickering pause screen
    Fixed by rendering the pause screen only once, at the start, and only running input handling in the pause loop

QUESTIONS:

Isn't rendering only the changing parts of a screen more "efficient"?
X GameObjects inheritance
Should I use sets in the input handler? Is that better?
X Ask about "backwards programming"
X One "Data" class can suffice for settings, constants etc. Is this inheritance? Can I just use less classes?
